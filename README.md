# AutoBench: Benchmarking *Automation* for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) with confidence

AutoBench is an **automation-cenrtic** benchmark designed to evaluate Large Models (LLMs and VLMs) for **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)**.  
In addition to performance assessment of LMs for structured information extraction and delivering key metrics, it uniquely emphasizes **prediction confidence scores** to enhance *automation* in IDP pipelines. 

What sets AutoBench apart is its focus on confidence scores, essential for **automating** IDP workflows. Confidence scores enable systems to:

*   **Automate validation** of high-confidence extractions, minimizing manual review.
*   **Intelligently route** low-confidence predictions for human-in-the-loop verification, streamlining exception handling.
*   **Optimize IDP pipelines** by leveraging confidence to prioritize document routing and manual intervention.

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure API Keys and Base URLs

API keys and base URLs must be set using an `.env` file.

#### Steps to Configure:

1. **Create the `.env` file:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root directory.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2. **Set API keys and base URLs:** Edit the `.env` file and provide the necessary values for the models you intend to benchmark.

    Example `.env` file:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Your OpenAI API Key
    CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # Your Anthropic Claude API Key
    QWEN2_API_BASE_URL=http://your-qwen2-api:8000/v1  # API Base URL for Qwen2
    GPT4V_API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1  # API Base URL for GPT-4V
    # Add API keys and base URLs for other models as needed
    ```

    **Important:** Ensure both API keys and base URLs are correctly set for each model before running benchmarks. Refer to `.env.example` for required variable names.

### 3. Dataset Download

AutoBench uses a publicly available dataset on Hugging Face Hub. You can download the dataset using the provided `download_dataset.sh` script.

#### Dataset Download Steps:

1. **Make the script executable:** Open your terminal, navigate to the `tools/` directory, and make the `download_dataset.sh` script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x download_dataset.sh
   ```
2. **Run the script:** Execute the script from the `tools/` directory:
   ```bash
   ./download_dataset.sh
   ```

   The script will:
    * Check if the `data/` directory already exists and ask if you want to remove and re-download the dataset if it does.
    * Download the `nanonets/nn-auto-bench-ds` dataset from Hugging Face Hub to the `data/` directory in the project root.

   After successful execution, the dataset will be located in the `data/` subdirectory.

### 4. Run Benchmarks

The benchmarking process is executed using `benchmark.py`.

## Usage

Run the benchmark script with the following command:

```bash
python tools/benchmark.py <model_name> --input_file <path_to_input_jsonl_file> [options]
```

**Before running benchmarks, ensure you have downloaded the dataset using the `download_dataset.sh` script as described in the "Dataset Download" section above.**  The `--input_file` argument in the `benchmark.py` command should then point to the appropriate JSONL file within the downloaded dataset directory (e.g., `data/metadata.jsonl`).

### Arguments:

- `<model_name>`: The model to evaluate (`qwen2`, `gpt4v`, `gpt4o`, etc.).
- `--input_file <path>`: Path to the JSONL dataset containing input data.

### Optional Parameters:

- `--max_workers <int>`: Number of worker threads (default: 16).
- `--few_shot <int>`: Number of few-shot examples (default: 1).
- `--conf_score_method <string>`: Method for computing confidence scores (`prob`, `yes_no`, `consistency`, default: `prob`).
- `--limit <int>`: Number of document samples to benchmark.

### Example:

```bash
python tools/benchmark.py gpt4o --input_file data/metadata.jsonl --max_workers 32 --few_shot 1 --conf_score_method prob --limit 10
```

## Output

Benchmark results are saved as JSONL files in the `results/` directory, following the naming convention:

```
benchmark_results_<model_name>_<dataset_name>_<layout>_<conf_score_method>_<timestamp>.jsonl
```

Each result entry includes:

- Execution time and API usage.
- Input paths and annotations.
- Prompts and raw model responses.
- Performance metrics: `parsing_accuracy`, `predicted_field_conf_scores`, `file_accuracy`, etc.

Summary metrics are also printed to the console.

**Note on Result Variability:** Due to the inherent stochastic nature of Large Language Models, slight variations in benchmark results may be observed across different runs. For reference, our benchmark results are available in the [`results`](results/) folder, providing a consistent baseline for comparison.

## Code Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`nnautobench/config/`** – Configuration files (`config.py`).
- **`nnautobench/inference/`** – Inference logic (`predictor.py`).
- **`nnautobench/models/`** – Vision-Language model implementations.
- **`nnautobench/utils/`** – Utility functions for JSON handling, metric computations, and prompt management.
- **`results/`** – Directory for storing benchmark outputs.
- **`tools/benchmark.py`** – Main script for running benchmarks.

### Model Versions and Benchmark Results

The benchmark was conducted using the following model versions. Links to our benchmark result files are provided for each model to facilitate result verification and comparison.  **Note:** Due to the stochastic nature of LLMs, your benchmark runs may exhibit slight variations from our provided results.
